 PURPOSES  
 
      *   ALLOW LOCAL INSTALLATION CENTERS TO SEND MESSAGES TO ALL NASTRAN
          USERS.

      *   LOCALLY PRESET CERTAIN NASTRAN SYSTEM PARAMETERS, SUCH AS OUTPUT
          LINES PER PAGE (LPP), HI-CORE (HIC (VAX ONLY)), ETC.
          THESE PARAMETERS CAN BE OVERRIDDEN BY USE OF THE NASTRAN CARD.
      
      *   LOAD THE BCD-LOOK-ALIKE WORDS FOR SUBROUTINE NUMTYP.
          (THE BINARY REPRESENTATIONS OF SOME FLOATING POINT NUMBERS AND
          THEIR CORRESPONDING BCD WORDS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME, AND SUBROUTINE
          NUMTYP MAY INCORRECTLY CLASSIFY THEM AS BCD WORDS.  ANY BCD WORD 
          ON THE LIST WILL BE REVERTED TO FLOATING POINT TYPE DATA.)

      *   SET THE NASTRAN (16) GINO (GENERAL INPUT AND OUTPUT) TIMING
          CONSTANTS.
          (TO OBTAIN THESE TIMING CONSTANTS FOR YOUR LOCAL SYSTEM, RUN
          DEMO PROBLEM D01002A SEVERAL TIMES AND GET THE AVERAGE FOR THESE
          CONSTANTS.)

      *   DEFINE TEXT TO BE PRINTED WITH DIAG 48.


   METHOD 

           THERE ARE FIVE SECTIONS IN THIS FILE. EACH SECTION IS SEPARATED
           BY AN EQUAL LINE, SUCH AS '========='.

           SECTION ONE BEGINS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NASINFO FILE
               AND GOES TO THE FIRST EQUAL LINE.  THIS SECTION DESCRIBES
               THE CONTENTS OF THE NASINFO FILE.

           SECTION TWO CONTAINS SYSTEM PARAMETERS THAT ARE  
               INSTALLATION DEPENDENT.

           SECTION THREE CONTAINS BCD-LOOK-ALIKE WORDS WHICH ARE REALLY
               FLOATING POINT NUMBERS (MACHINE DEPENDENT).  THIS SECTION IS
               USED BY SUBROUTINE NUMTYP.

           SECTION FOUR CONTAINS LOCAL INSTALLATION MESSAGES. 

           SECTION FIVE IS RESERVED FOR DIAG 48 INFORMATION MESSAGES AND
               CONTAINS AN ITEMIZATION OF NEW FEATURES IN THIS RELEASE.
           
   FORMATS OF SECTIONS

           THE FORMAT OF THE FIRST SECTION IS 80 COLUMN TEXT.

           THE FORMAT OF THE SECOND SECTION IS A 4 LETTER SYMBOL; FOLLOWED  
           BY AN "="; FOLLOWED BY A 7-DIGIT VALUE; AND AT THE END A COMMENT.
           A FORTRAN FORMAT FOR THIS IS (A4,'=',I7).  THE SYMBOL NAMES
           ARE UNIQUE AND CANNOT BE CHANGED.  THE ORDER OF THE SYMBOLS IS
           ARBITRARY.  A VALUE OF -99 INDICATES THAT THE PARAMETER IS NOT SET.
           ANY SYMBOL THAT IS NOT USED (I.E., VALUE = -99) CAN BE DELETED.  
           BLANK LINES ARE OPTIONAL.  THE SYMBOL 'TIM' REQUIRES TWO LINES 
           OF INPUT VALUES.

           THE FORMAT FOR THE THIRD SECTION CONSISTS OF TWO LINES PER
           ENTRY.  THE FIRST LINE HAS A FORTRAN FORMAT OF (I2,I4,2X,A20)
           AND SPECIFIES THE COMPUTER FOR WHICH THE DATA IN THE SECOND
           LINE IS TO APPLY.  THE FIRST FIELD IS THE ID NUMBER ASSIGNED
           TO THE COMPUTER (THIS NUMBER CANNOT BE CHANGED).  THE SECOND 
           FIELD DEFINES HOW MANY BCD-LOOK-ALIKE VALUES ARE GIVEN
           IN THE FOLLOWING LINE.  THE LAST FIELD GIVES TEXT THAT 
           DEFINES THE COMPUTER.  THE FORTRAN FORMAT OF THE SECOND LINE IS
           (5X,19(A4,1X)).  
                                                
           THE FORMAT OF SECTION FOUR IS 80 COLUMN TEXT.  ALL LINES INCLUDED
           WILL BE PRINTED IN LOCAL NASTRAN JOBS IF THE NASINFO
           FILE IS ASSIGNED.  A NEW PAGE IS INDICATED BY PUTTING '====    ' 
           IN COLUMNS 1 THRU 8.  IF NO TEXT IS GIVEN, THE LAST EQUAL-LINE 
           SHOULD IMMEDIATELY FOLLOW THE PREVIOUS EQUAL-LINE, WITH NO 
           INTERVENING BLANK LINES.

           THE FORMAT OF SECTION FIVE IS 80 COLUMN TEXT.


DESIGN REQUIREMENTS 

           THIS FILE SHOULD BE READ-ONLY AND ASSIGNED TO NASTRAN.
           IF THIS FILE DOES NOT EXIST, NASTRAN WILL NOT ABORT.
           THIS FILE IS PROCESSED ONLY BY SUBROUTINE NSINFO.  
           THE SUBROUTINE CALLING SEQUENCE IS AS FOLLOWS:
                NSINFO CALLED BY NASCAR
                NASCAR CALLED BY TTLPGE
                TTLPGE CALLED BY XCSA
                XCSA   CALLED BY SEMINT
                SEMINT CALLED BY ...


COMMENTS ABOUT GINO TIMING CONSTANTS (TIM) IN SECTION 2 FOLLOW:

           IF THE VALUE OF TIM IS NOT 16, THEN THIS LINE AND THE  
           NEXT 2 LINES ARE SKIPPED.
           IN EACH NASTRAN JOB, NASTRAN RUNS THROUGH A SERIES OF GINO TIMING
           COMPUTATIONS AND ESTABLISHES THE 16 GINO TIMING CONSTANTS. IF THESE
           CONSTANTS ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE TO NASTRAN, THE TIMING COMPUTATIONS
           ARE SKIPPED, THUS SAVING CPU TIME IN ALL NASTRAN JOBS.

           THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO MAKE THESE CONSTANTS AVAILABLE TO NASTRAN -
           (1)  HARD CODE THE CONSTANTS TO NASTRAN VIA LABEL COMMON /NTIME/
                IN SUBROUTINE SEMDBD. (COMPILE AND RE-LINK LINK1).
           (2)  ENTER 'TIM = 16', AND IN THE NEXT 2 LINES, ENTER THE 16 
                TIMING CONSTANTS IN (12X,8F7.2) FORMAT.

           TO OBTAIN THESE 16 TIMING CONSTANTS, SUBMIT A SIMPLE NASTRAN RUN
           WITH A 'NASTRAN BULKDATA=-3' CARD.  THESE CONSTANTS MAY THEN BE
           EDITED INTO THIS NASINFO FILE.  TIME UNIT IS IN MICROSECONDS. 
           IF TIME IS LESS THAN 0.001 MICROSECOND, USE +0.001 
           (ZERO TIMES MAY GET NASTRAN INTO TROUBLE.)

NASTRAN RELEASE NEWS -





93 RELEASE
----------

MODAL STRAIN ENERGY IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR EIGENVALUE PROBLEMS (SOLUTION 3).
SUBROUTINE GPFDR WAS EXPANDED TO COMPUTE THE STRAIN ENERGIES FOR THE
DYNAMIC CASE.  A 'MODES' CARD AND AN 'ESE' CARD ARE NEEDED IN THE CASE 
CONTROL.  THE 'MODES' CARD REQUESTS THE NUMBER OF MODES TO BE PRINTED 
(DEFAULT IS 1 MODE).  THE RIGID FORMAT DISP3 HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO INCLUDE 
THE GPFDR MODULE AND OTHER NECESSARY CHANGES.
(REFERENCE - 'MODAL STRAIN ENERGIES IN COSMIC NASTRAN DMAP ALTER' BY
B. D. SNYDER AND V. B. VENKAYYA, WPAFB, DATE UNKNOWN, 1990-1991?)

THE TEMPERATURE LOAD SET LIMIT WAS INCREASED TO 360 (PREVIOUSLY 66). 
LIMITATION WAS MENTIONED IN W. WALLS PAPER AT THE 20TH NASTRAN USERS' 
COLLOQUIUM, P.134.

WHEN A USER'S DMAP ALTER CAUSES A FATAL ERROR, AND DIAG 14 (PRINT DMAP 
LISTING) IS NOT REQUESTED, THE RIGID FORMAT DMAP LISTING IS NOW AUTOMATICALLY 
PRINTED.

THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS WERE CORRECTED -
. PSHELL CARDS REJECTED BY IFP DUE TO MID ERROR
. MATRIX PARTITION ERROR.  FAILURE IN SUBROUTINE BLDPK/INTPKI 
. PCOMP CARD ERROR IF MORE THAN 32 LAYERS SPECIFIED
. EXTRANEOUS LINE IN PLOTTING.  INPUT DECK INCLUDED OFFSET DATA AND SETS
. END-OF-FILE ENCOUNTERED DURING PROCESSING OF MULTIPLE PLOAD4 CARDS 
  WITH QUAD4 AND TRIA3 ELEMENTS.
. SOLUTION 3 ERROR DURING EIGENVALUE COMPUTATION, WITH DIAG 11 AND/OR 16 
  FLAGS TURNED ON.   MESSAGE NO. *****. (1992 VERSION ONLY)
. INPUTT5 ERROR WHILE PROCESSING MORE THAN 5 FILES ON INPUT TAPE.
. MPYAD WITH SPECIAL MATRICES, SUCH AS IDENTITY AND DIAGONAL MATRICES, ROW-
  VECTORS. 1XN AND NX1 RECTANGULAR MATRICES.
. THE OFFSETS OF CBAR, CQUAD4, CTRIA3 ARE IGNORED IN PLOTTING IF THE OFFSET 
  OPTION N IS NEGATIVE.
. COMPLEX FBS COMPUTATION. (FBSIII AND FBSIV ARE TEMPORARILY INACTIVE)

THE MATRIX GENERATOR MODULE, MATGEN, HAS BEEN EXPANDED. THE OPTIONS ARE:
  1. TO GENERATE A REAL IDENTITY MATRIX
  2. TO GENERATE AN IDENTITY MATRIX TRAILER (THE MATRIX IS NOT GENERATED)
  3. TO GENERATE A DIAGONAL MATRIX FROM INPUT FILE
  4. TO GENERATE A PATTERN MATRIX
  5. TO GENERATE A MATRIX OF PSEUDO-RANDOM NUMBERS (RANGE FROM 0.0 TO 1.0)
  6. TO GENERATE A PARTITIONING VECTOR FOR USE IN PARTN OR MERGE
  7. TO GENERATE A NULL MATRIX
  8. CURRENTLY NOT USED
  9. TO GENERATE A TRANSFORMATION BETWEEN EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL SEQUENCE
     MATRICES FOR G-SET SIZE MATRICES
 10. TO ALTER DATA BLOCK TRAILER.

A UTILITY MODULE, VECGRB, WAS ADDED. IT GENERATES 
   (1) GEOMETRIC RIGID BODY VECTORS
   (2) A G-SET SIZED COORDINATE TRANSFORMATION MATRIX FROM THE BASIC
       COORDINATE SYSTEM TO THE GLOBAL COORDINATE SYSTEM.

THE INPUTT1, INPUTT2, AND INPUTT4 MODULES INCLUDE NEW OPTIONS TO READ FORTRAN
TAPES AS GENERATED FROM MSC/OUTPUT1, OUTPUT2, AND OUTPUT4 MODULES. 
INPUTT4 HANDLES ONLY MATRIX DATA BLOCKS.

A NEW OUTPUT4 MODULE EXISTS TO COPY GINO MATRIX DATA BLOCKS TO AN EXTERNAL 
FILE IN ASCII (FORMATTED) OR BINARY (UNFORMATTED) RECORDS, IN DENSE (FIRST TO 
LAST NON-ZERO TERMS IN MATRIX COLUMNS), OR SPARSE (BY STRINGS) METHODS. 
OUTPUT4 DOES NOT HANDLE TABLE DATA BLOCKS, EXCEPT KELM, MELM, BELM, KDICT, 
MDICT, AND BDICT.  SEE USER'S MANUAL SUPPLEMENT FOR FURTHER DOCUMENTATION.

A NEW GRBVEC MODULE EXISTS TO GENERATE GEOMETRIC RIGID BODY VECTORS ABOUT A 
GRID POINT OR ORIGIN.                

THE USER'S MANUAL IS PROVIDED ON THE DELIVERABLE TAPE AS TEXT FILES.  THE
FILES ARE IN ASCII, 80 COLUMN FORMAT.  THE USER CAN EXAMINE THESE FILES WITH
A SYSTEM EDITOR, OR THROUGH THE USE OF THE NASTHELP PROGRAM, WHICH IS INCLUDED 
WITH THIS NASTRAN RELEASE.  THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS A USER TO SEARCH, READ AND/OR 
PRINT A PORTION OF THE FILE QUICKLY.  THE ENTIRE MANUAL IS STORED IN THE 
FOLLOWING FILES -

    EXEC.TXT - NASTRAN EXECUTIVE CONTROL SECTIONS
    CASE.TXT - THE CASE CONTROL SECTIONS
    BULK.TXT - INPUT BULK DATA SECTIONS
    MSSG.TXT - NASTRAN FATAL, WARNING AND INFORMATION MESSAGES
    PLOT.TXT - NASTRAN PLOTTING
    SUBS.TXT - SUBSTRUCTURING SECTIONS
    INTR.TXT - INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL INFORMATION
    UMFF.TXT - NASTRAN USER MASTER FILE
    DMAP.TXT - NASTRAN DMAPS
    DICT.TXT - NASTRAN DICTIONARY
    RFMT.TXT - NASTRAN RIGID FORMATS

NASTHELP IS USER FRIENDLY AND REQUIRES NO WRITTEN INSTRUCTION, EXCEPT THAT
THE NASTHELP EXECUTABLE AND THE .TXT FILES MUST BE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY.

ATTEMPTS TO MAKE NASTRAN MORE GENERIC AND EASIER TO CONVERT TO OTHER COMPUTER 
PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED WITH THIS RELEASE.  TEST VERSIONS OF NASTRAN WERE 
GENERATED ON IBM RS/6000, SILICON GRAPHICS, HP, SUN, CONVEX, AND CRAY 
COMPUTERS.  THESE TEST VERSIONS WERE TESTED ONLY IN A LIMITED MANNER AND ARE 
NOT SUPPORTED BY COSMIC.  THE NASTRAN CODE THAT WAS USED FOR THESE TEST 
PLATFORMS IS CALLED THE "GENERIC VERSION" AND IS AVAILABLE FROM COSMIC BY 
REQUEST.
